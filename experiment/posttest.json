    {
      "question": "1. In the simulation, when you increased the quantum number n from 1 to 5, what did you observe about the number of peaks (antinodes)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Number of peaks decreased",
        "b": "Number of peaks remained the same",
        "c": "Number of peaks increased to match n",
        "d": "Number of peaks became random"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The number of antinodes (peaks) in the wavefunction equals the quantum number n. So for n=5, there are exactly 5 peaks."
      },

      "question": "2. When you enabled the |Ψ|² (probability) display, at which positions was the probability zero?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At the center of the box only",
        "b": "At the boundaries and at the node positions",
        "c": "Everywhere inside the box",
        "d": "Probability was never zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The probability density |Ψ|² is zero at the boundaries (x=0, x=L) and at all node positions where the wavefunction crosses zero."

      "question": "3. Based on your observations, how did the energy change when you doubled the quantum number from n=2 to n=4?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Energy doubled",
        "b": "Energy became 4 times larger",
        "c": "Energy remained the same",
        "d": "Energy decreased"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Since E ∝ n², when n doubles from 2 to 4, the energy increases by a factor of (4/2)² = 4."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "4. What did you observe about the wavelength when you increased the box length L?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Wavelength decreased",
        "b": "Wavelength increased proportionally",
        "c": "Wavelength remained constant",
        "d": "Wavelength became zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The wavelength in a particle-in-a-box is λ = 2L/n wavelength increases proportionally with box length L."

      "question": "5. In the Live Measurements panel, what was the relationship you observed between nodes and quantum number n?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Nodes = n",
        "b": "Nodes = n + 1",
        "c": "Nodes = n - 1",
        "d": "Nodes = 2n"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "From the simulation, you can verify that the number of nodes (zero crossings inside the box) equals n - 1 for quantum state n."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "6. When comparing the ground state (n=1) with excited states (n>1), what did you notice about where the particle is most likely to be found?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Always at the center for all states",
        "b": "Always at the boundaries for all states",
        "c": "At different positions depending on the quantum number",
        "d": "Uniformly distributed for all states"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The probability distribution changes with n. For n=1, maximum probability is at center. For higher n, there are multiple maxima at antinode positions."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "7. What happened to the oscillation frequency when you increased the quantum number n?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Oscillation became slower",
        "b": "Oscillation became faster",
        "c": "Oscillation speed remained unchanged",
        "d": "Oscillation stopped completely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Higher energy states (higher n) have higher frequency of oscillation since ω ∝ E ∝ n². This is visible in the time evolution of the wavefunction."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "8. From your graph of Energy vs Quantum Number, what type of relationship did you observe?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Linear relationship (straight line)",
        "b": "Quadratic relationship (parabola)",
        "c": "Inverse relationship (hyperbola)",
        "d": "No clear relationship"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The energy plot shows a quadratic (parabolic) relationship because E ∝ n². The graph curves upward as n increases."
