      "question": "2. What is the effect of changing the amplitude A on the wavefunction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It changes the frequency of the wavefunction",
        "b": "It changes the shape of the wavefunction",

      "question": "3. In an infinite potential well, where is the probability of finding the particle zero?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At the center only",
        "b": "At the boundaries of the well",
        "c": "Everywhere inside the well",
        "d": "At random undefined positions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "In an infinite well, ψ = 0 at the walls (boundaries), so probability is zero there."

      "question": "4. What happens to the energy spacing between levels as the quantum number n increases in an infinite potential well?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Energy spacing increases",
        "b": "Energy spacing decreases",
        "c": "Energy spacing remains constant",
        "d": "Energy levels become continuous"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Energy levels follow n², so the gap between consecutive levels decreases for large n."

      "question": "5. What determines the curvature of the wavefunction inside a potential well?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Amplitude only",
        "b": "Particle mass and energy",
        "c": "Box width only",
        "d": "Time-dependent part of the wavefunction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Curvature is related to kinetic energy and mass through the Schrödinger equation: higher energy → more curvature."
