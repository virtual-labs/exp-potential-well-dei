      "question": "2. What is the time-dependent wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ψ(x,t) = A·cos(nπx/L)·sin(ωt)",
        "b": "Ψ(x,t) = A·sin(nπx/L)·cos(ωt)",
        "c": "Ψ(x,t) = A·sin(nx/L)·cos(t)",
        "d": "Ψ(x,t) = A·cos(nx/L)·sin(t)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The correct form combines a sinusoidal spatial component sin(nπx/L) that satisfies boundary conditions, and a cosine time component cos(ωt) for time evolution."

      "question": "3. What happens to the energy levels when the box length L decreases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Energy levels move closer together",
        "b": "Energy levels remain unchanged",
        "c": "Energy levels become more widely spaced (higher energy)",
        "d": "Energy levels become continuous"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Since E ∝ 1/L², decreasing L increases the energy. In a narrower box, greater confinement leads to higher quantized energy levels."

        "d": "2n nodes"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The number of nodes (zero crossings inside the box, excluding boundaries) equals n - 1. For example, n=1 has 0 nodes, n=2 has 1 node, n=3 has 2 nodes, etc."

        "a": "Ψ = maximum at boundaries",

        "c": "Ψ = 1 at boundaries",
        "d": "Ψ is undefined at boundaries"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "At the walls of an infinite potential well, the wavefunction must be zero (Ψ(0) = Ψ(L) = 0) because the particle cannot exist outside the box."

      "question": "7. What is the formula for energy levels in a 1D infinite potential well?",

        "d": "Eₙ = n²h/(8mL)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The energy levels are given by Eₙ = n²h²/(8mL²), showing that energy is proportional to n² and inversely proportional to L²."

    {
      "question": "8. Why can't a particle in an infinite potential well have zero energy (E = 0)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because zero energy violates the Heisenberg uncertainty principle",
        "b": "Because the particle has too much mass",
        "c": "Because the box width is infinite",
        "d": "Because the wavefunction becomes imaginary"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A particle confined to a finite region must have some kinetic energy due to the uncertainty principle. If E = 0, the particle would have zero momentum, violating Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2."
