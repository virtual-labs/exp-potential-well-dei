        "a": "To describe the spatial distribution of the particle",

      "question": "3. What happens to the energy levels when the width of a potential well decreases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Energy levels move closer together",
        "b": "Energy levels remain unchanged",
        "c": "Energy levels become more widely spaced",
        "d": "Energy levels become continuous"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "In a narrower potential well, confinement increases, causing quantized energy levels to become more widely spaced."

    {
      "question": "4. Which statement correctly describes the wavefunction inside an infinite potential well?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The wavefunction is zero everywhere",
        "b": "The wavefunction is sinusoidal inside the well and zero at the boundaries",
        "c": "The wavefunction is constant throughout the well",
        "d": "The wavefunction increases linearly with position"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "In an infinite potential well, the wavefunction is sinusoidal inside and must be zero at the boundaries because the particle cannot exist outside the well."

    {
      "question": "5. Why can't a particle in an infinite potential well have zero energy (E = 0)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because zero energy violates the uncertainty principle",
        "b": "Because the particle has too much mass",
        "c": "Because the well width is infinite",
        "d": "Because the time-dependent wavefunction becomes undefined"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A particle confined to a finite region must have some kinetic energy due to the uncertainty principle; E = 0 is not allowed."
      },
